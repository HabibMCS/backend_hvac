# HVAC Data Processing Pipeline

This project provides a pipeline for downloading, processing, and uploading HVAC system data. It leverages various scripts to handle data transformation, COP calculation, uncertainty summary generation, and uploads the results to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in an organized file structure.

└── README.md                 # Project documentation.
```

## GCP File Structure

The processed data is organized in the following structure in Google Cloud Storage (GCS):

```

│   ├── data_2024-10-01.csv
│   ├── data_2024-10-02.csv
│   ├── data_2024-10-03.csv
│   └── ... (more files for each processed date)

```

## Features

- **Data Download**: Automatically downloads HVAC data for the past two weeks daily.
- **Data Processing**: Passes the data through transformation scripts, calculates COP, and generates uncertainty summaries.
- **Cloud Upload**: Organizes and uploads processed files to Google Cloud Storage with a defined file structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`
  - `google-cloud-storage`
  - `env` (for environment variables)
  - Any other dependencies used in Ahmad's scripts.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Google Cloud Authentication**:
   Ensure your GCP credentials are set up correctly. Use a service account and the associated key file or set up your credentials using the GCP SDK.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```
   TOKEN=<your_token>
   SYSTEM_URI=<your_system_uri>
   UNIT_URI=<your_unit_uri>
   SERVICE_URI=<your_service_uri>
   ```

## Running the Pipeline

To run the data downloading and processing script, execute the following command:

```bash
python nain.py
```
